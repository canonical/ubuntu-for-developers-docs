**Install proposed updates (optional)**

Every .NET release that does not contain security fixes is only availabe with
a delay of at least a week and sometimes much longer. 

If you want to install updates as soon as they are available see the section
{ref}`dotnet-install-proposed-updates`; otherwise you can skip
this part.
